# Frontend Recruitment test

Hi there!
It's a repo for new team members!

If we sent you the link to this repo this means you have good understanding about front-end technologies and now you are officially a candidate for the job. Congrats!

The problem we have with most of applicants is that they don't provide us good updated projects to prove their skills, so we have to challenge them!

Choose your challenge or challenges will choose you!

- [First Challenge](https://github.com/dnj/frontend-recruitment/blob/master/challenges/1)
- [Second Challenge](https://github.com/dnj/frontend-recruitment/blob/master/challenges/2)

Follow the instructions on each and send us a PR; after that please be available for further contacts by phone and github.

Wish you best of luck.
